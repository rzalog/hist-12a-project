        <h1>Common Themes in History of Mass Incarceration</h1>
        
        <h2>Settler Colonialism</h2>
		<p>
			The story of Mass Incarceration in the US starts before it's founding in the late 16th century. Between then and now, Los Angeles became the incarceral capital of the world, maintaining more
			prisons and prisoners than anyone else. How did this happen? There were several factors that led to this development, and the below timeline is designed to capture key events over the course of history that led to the current state of mass incarceration in the US.
        </p>

        <h2>Use of Rhetoric</h2>
		<p>
            Rhetoric was often used, especially in legal documents, in order to hid the true intentions of created laws. One example was again the 1850 Act for the Governance and Protection of Indians. Even just the title it is clear that the law makes it sound like the act was created for the Indians' benefits, but in reality, it only served to oppress them.
        </p>

        <h2>Profit</h2>
		<p>
            During the time of slavery, plantation owners would have access to a cheap source of labor and would be able to increase production so that they could profit on that labor. After the Jim Crow era, the South lost that source of labor. However, it wasn't too much different because blacks didn't have much right to land or legal power, so they a lot of black people still ended up working for white people and got underpaid. In the modern prison system, prison inmates are put to work to produce something of value, thus a source of cheap labor. To build and maintain state and federal prisons, the government purchases infrastructure and materials from companies who produce what prisons need. These self-interested parties benefit from the prison system, and thus have a political incentive to keep being hard on crime, and to keep the prison system growing because it means more profit.
        </p>

        <h2>Deportation</h2>
		<p>
            Deportation was not a concept that was in the united states constitution. The concept of plenary power arose, which is the idea that matters not stated in the constitution fall into the jurisdiction of the executive branch of government. This means that things like deportation are not considered crimes, and thus illegal immigrants do not have rights to things like due process. This has been very controversial, allowing laws to be created that do not give illegal immigrants any chance to defend themselves and not be deported.
